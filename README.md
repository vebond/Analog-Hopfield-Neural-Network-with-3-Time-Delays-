# Analog-Hopfield-Neural-Network-with-3-Time-Delays-
Bondarenko (2024) model of Analog Hopfield Neural Network with Three Time Delays -  program codes

Main program code file is "nn3b.c"; two input files "amatrix" and "inity" are for the connectivity matrix and initial conditions for neural states, respectively; file "ampl_ex" is the output file for excitatory Hopfield neural network. By changing amatrix and inity you can run different types of neural network protocols.
